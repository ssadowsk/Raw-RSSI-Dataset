# Raw-RSSI-Dataset

This RSSI Dataset is a comprehensive set of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) readings gathered from within a meeting room. Three wireless technologies were used consisting of:
 - WiFi (IEEE 802.11n 2.4GHz band)
 - Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and
 - Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4)
 
 For the experimentation, the equipment utilized consisted of Raspberry Pi 3 Model Bs, Gimbal Series 10 Beacons, and Series 2 Xbees with Arduino Uno microcontrollers.
